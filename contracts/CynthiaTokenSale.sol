/**
 * @title CynthiaTokenSale
 * @dev Implements a token sale mechanism for CynthiaToken ($CYNTHIA).
 * This contract allows users to buy $CYNTHIA tokens at a fixed rate of 1 $ETH per token.
 * Features:
 * - Supports fractional token purchases down to 18 decimal places.
 * - Implements reentrancy protection for security.
 * - Allows contract owner to withdraw accumulated ETH.
 * - Provides a function to check the contract's current $CYNTHIA token balance.
 * - Emits events for token purchases and ETH withdrawals.
 * - Uses OpenZeppelin's IERC20, Ownable, and ReentrancyGuard contracts for standard functionality and security.
